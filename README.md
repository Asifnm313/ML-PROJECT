## MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT
## Car Price Prediction in the US Market
## Project Description
A Chinese automobile company aims to enter the US market and seeks to understand the factors affecting car prices. This project uses a dataset of cars in the American market to identify significant variables that influence car prices and build machine learning models to predict them. The findings will assist the company in designing competitive vehicles and formulating market strategies.

## Steps to Complete the Project
1. **Loading and Preprocessing**
   - **Load the dataset and perform:**
     - Data cleaning.
     - Handling missing values.
     - Encoding categorical variables.
     - Feature scaling.
2. **Model Implementation**
   Develop the following regression models:

   - **Linear Regression**
   - **Decision Tree Regressor**
   - **Random Forest Regressor**
   - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
   - **Support Vector Regressor**
3. **Model Evaluation**
   Evaluate models using:

   - **R-squared**
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
       Identify and justify the best-performing model.
4. **Feature Importance Analysis**
   - **Perform feature selection to identify variables with the greatest impact on car prices.**
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - **Use grid search or similar techniques to tune the best-performing model and improve its performance.**
